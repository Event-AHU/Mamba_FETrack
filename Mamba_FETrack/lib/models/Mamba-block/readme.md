# Mamba Block: Integration Guide
This guide provides instructions on integrating our proposed Mamba blocks into the your network.
This folder includes three specific Mamba blocks implemented in the mamba_module.py file.

## Installation
1. Install the official Mamba library by following the instructions in the [hustvl/Vim](https://github.com/hustvl/Vim) repository.
2. After installing the official Mamba library, replace the mamba_simpy.py file in the installation directory with the mamba_simpy.py file provided in this mamba block directory.

## Mamba Block Modules
The Mamba Block modules introduced in the paper are available in the mamba_module.py file in this directory. These modules offer advanced features for pan-sharpening and can be seamlessly integrated into your existing projects.
